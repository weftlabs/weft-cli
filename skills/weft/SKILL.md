# Weft

Weft Account is a self-custodial wallet for paying x402-protected endpoints from inside an agent host. The three tools — `weft_balance`, `weft_search`, `weft_fetch` — let you check funds, find paid resources, and buy from them within the user's spending policy.

## Setup

If `weft_*` tools are not available, run:

```sh
bash <(curl -sSL https://weftlabs.com/skill/install.sh)
```

This installs the Weft MCP server (`https://weft.network/mcp`) into Claude Code and walks the user through the browser OAuth flow.

Direct equivalent:

```sh
claude mcp add weft --remote https://weft.network/mcp
```

## Usage

- Use `weft_balance` before suggesting any paid action; abort if `balance.wallet_usdc < expected_cost`.
- Use `weft_search` to discover paid resources. Free for authenticated buyers in v1.
- Use `weft_fetch(url, max_cost_usd)` to retrieve a paid resource. Always set `max_cost_usd` to a tight ceiling — never omit it. If the returned cost is suspicious (very new merchant, no settlement history), flag to the user before re-using.

## Errors

If a tool returns an error with code `POLICY_VIOLATION_*`, the user has exceeded their spending policy. Surface the `dashboard_url` so they can adjust. Don't retry silently.

If a tool returns `SETTLEMENT_FAILED`, the user's transaction is in `locked` status — surface and stop.
